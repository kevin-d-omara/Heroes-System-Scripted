## Tenets
The following are the tenets this mod follows:
1. Help the players get started playing as quick and easy as possible.
1. Once the game has started, don't automate anything (players like to be in control of the game state).
1. Rules reminders are nice, as long as they are non-intrusive and actually useful.
1. Document everything well.
1. Keep the mod moddable.
1. When choosing between high fidelity and performance, always choose high fidelity. Assets are loaded once per session, but viewed many times and must be both legible and a pleasure to view.

## Developer Setup
1. Clone this repository.
1. Install the [atom-tabletopsimulator-lua](https://github.com/Berserk-Games/atom-tabletopsimulator-lua/wiki) plugin for Atom ([instructions](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/atom/))
