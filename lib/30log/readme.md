## Attribution
The code is from a [fork of 30log](https://github.com/kevin-d-omara/30log/releases/tag/30log-1.3.1-1).

## Naming
The local file `class.ttslua` is called `30log.ttslua` in the source repository.
It has been renamed to fit in with the project convention of naming a file the same as the class that it dumps into the namespace.
